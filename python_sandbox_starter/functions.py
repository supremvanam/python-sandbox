# A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. In Python, we do not use parentheses and curly brackets, we use indentation with tabs or spaces
def sayHello(name = "suprem"):
    print(f"hello {name}")

sayHello()

def getSum (num):
    return num * num

print(getSum(7))

# A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
# A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression. Very similar to JS arrow functions
